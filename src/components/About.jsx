                    person with strong communication skills, and I love working

                    In addition to creating content, I'm actively expanding my
                    knowledge in software development. I'm currently learning
                    JavaScript, Python, React, Flask, and Node through
                    expert-led instruction. Learning new technologies hands-on
                    is my jam! And when I'm not creating content or coding, you
                    can find me producing music or playing games - I Let's
                    connect and explore our creative passions together!
