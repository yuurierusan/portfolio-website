                    Hey there! I'm a versatile content creator who thrives in
                    fast-paced, deadline-driven environments. I'm a people
                    person with strong communication skills, and I love working
                    with teams to coordinate production. When it comes to
                    traditional and digital audio and video production, I'm your
                    go-to guy! I'm skilled in using Adobe CC, Microsoft Office,
                    FCP X, Da-Vinci Resolve, and handling cameras & lights. I'm
                    also a tech-savvy individual who is comfortable working with
                    different computer environments such as Windows, Macintosh,
                    and Linux.
                </p>

                    In addition to creating content, I'm actively expanding my
                    knowledge in software development. I'm currently learning
                    JavaScript, Python, React, Django, and Node.js through
                    expert-led instruction. Learning new technologies hands-on
                    is my jam! And when I'm not creating content or coding, you
                    can find me producing music or playing the percussion - I
                    have a strong understanding of music theory. Let's connect
                    and explore our creative passions together!
